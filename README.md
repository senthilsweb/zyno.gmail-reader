### How to create google App-Specific Passwords?

* Go to [https://myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com/) and Login 
* Click On Security
* Enable 2-Step Verification under Signing into Google
* Click App passwords (and sign in again)
* On the App Passwords screen use the drop downs to select the following:
    * Select app (Select the app this password will be for)
    * Select Device (Select the device this app will be for)
* Once you have selected the above settings click the GENERATE button.
* Your new password will be randomly generated and displayed on your screen.
* Copy it down somewhere for safekeeping as you only get to see this once. `If you lose this password youâ€™ll need to generate a new one!`
* Take your new password and use it in place of your regular password when signing in to a Less Secure App. Using this password will let you continue using the app like normal and the best part is most of the time you will only need to enter it once to have it saved!
